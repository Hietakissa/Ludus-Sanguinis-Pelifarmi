  - text: NAME, is it? Well then, let's hope Lady Luck is on your side tonight, NAME.
      Let's get on to the rules of <color=#f0290e>Ludus Sanguinis</color>.
  - text: The game begins with each of us being dealt a <color=#f0290e>hand of five
      cards</color>. These cards are made specifically for Ludus Sanguinis, and range
      from <color=#f0290e>0 to 16</color>.
  - text: We take turns placing down <color=#f0290e>as many cards as we want</color>.
      When you run out of cards to play, a new hand is dealt, and you will be given
      an <color=#0e52f0>item</color> with a special property related to the game.
  - text: The played cards will be counted, yours versus mine. The <color=#f0290e>difference</color>
      of the values will be added to the <color=#f0290e>pot</color>. If the pot exceeds
      the maximum capacity, the player who played the larger sum will lose a <color=#f0290e>life</color>.
  - text: Now, what makes this game fun is the fact that you will <color=#f0290e>not</color>
      be told the current sum in the pot, unless you are able to inspect it with
      one of the aforementioned items. In general, you must keep track of it <color=#f0290e>yourself</color>.
  - text: "Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that any \u201Cleft over\u201D
      value in the pot when it gets filled will be <color=#f0290e>carried over</color>."
  - text: "We will both start off with <color=#f0290e>3 \u201Clives\u201D</color>,
      so to speak. Whomever loses all their lives first, naturally <color=#f0290e>loses
      the game</color>."
  - text: I hear one can press <color=#f0290e>'TAB'</color> to pause the game. I'm
      not quite sure what that means, but I assure you, the game cannot be stopped.
  - text: Are the rules clear? Now, let's begin.
