  - text: NAME, is it? Well then, let's hope Lady Luck is on your side tonight, NAME.
      Let's get on to the rules of Ludus Sanguinis.
  - text: The game begins with each of us being dealt a hand of five cards. These
      cards are made specifically for Ludus Sanguinis, and range from 0 to 16.
  - text: We take turns placing down as many cards as we want. When you run out of
      cards to play, a new hand is dealt, and you will be given an item with a special
      property related to the game.
  - text: The played cards will be counted, yours versus mine. The difference of
      the values will be added to the pot. If the pot exceeds the maximum capacity,
      the player who played the larger sum will lose a life.
  - text: Now, what makes this game fun is the fact that you will not be told the
      current sum in the pot, unless you are able to inspect it with one of the aforementioned
      items. In general, you must keep track of it yourself.
  - text: "Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that any \u201Cleft over\u201D
      value in the pot when it gets filled will be transferred over to the next round."
  - text: "We will both start off with 3 \u201Clives\u201D, so to speak. Whomever
      loses all their lives first, naturally loses the game."
  - text: Are the rules clear? Now, let's begin.
